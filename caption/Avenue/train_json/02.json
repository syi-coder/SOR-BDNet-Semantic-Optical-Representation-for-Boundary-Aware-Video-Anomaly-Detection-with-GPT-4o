    "228": " In a public transit area, three individuals walk steadily along a wide pathway towards a building entrance. Each person maintains a straight and unobstructed path, reflecting typical pedestrian behavior. There are no deviations from the main direction or unusual actions, as everyone moves consistently towards the entrance in a normal manner.",
    "233": " In this surveillance scene, the area features a walkway leading into a building entrance. Three individuals are visible: one on the left, one in the middle, and one on the right of the path. Each person is walking steadily towards the entrance, exhibiting normal pedestrian behavior. There are no anomalies or deviations from expected walking patterns, as all individuals are moving in the primary direction without any sudden changes or unusual interactions.",
    "234": " In the scene, a pathway leads directly to a building entrance with three individuals visible. On the left, one person is stationary and appears to be engaging with a notice board, suggesting they are reading or examining information. Two other individuals are seen walking towards the building entrance, maintaining alignment with the primary path and demonstrating typical movement. All actions observed align with expected pedestrian behavior, with no deviations identified.",
    "236": " In this scene, three individuals are walking towards a building entrance along a wide, paved path. Each person maintains a steady and direct course without deviating from the main route. Their movements are coordinated and typical of pedestrians approaching a public facility, with no unusual or abnormal behavior detected.",
    "238": " In a well-structured urban environment, several individuals are observed walking along a wide tiled pathway. Each pedestrian is maintaining their trajectory, heading toward a covered area near a staircase. On the left, one person approaches the covered structure directly. Nearby, another moves centrally along the path, with a third slightly to the right, all maintaining a normal pace without deviation. The scene reflects typical pedestrian movement without any anomalies or unusual behavior.",
    "240": " In the scene, the open space is characterized by a central walkway bordered by grass, leading onto stairs. Three individuals navigate this environment. On the far left, a person walks towards the main path from the grass, aligning with the pathway. The central and rightmost individuals proceed smoothly along the walkway, aligning with typical pedestrian movement patterns. No unusual behaviors or interactions are observed, as all pedestrians collectively follow the expected path.",
    "241": " In a semi-crowded public space, several individuals are seen walking along the paved paths towards the building entrance. They maintain a steady pace and direction, aligning with typical pedestrian behavior expected in such an area. The absence of unusual movements or deviations suggests a normal flow of traffic, as people appear focused on entering the building.",
    "243": " In this public outdoor setting, four pedestrians are seen using the main tiled path. One person is centered slightly to the left, walking steadily, while another near the stairway angles slightly towards the structure. A third individual, positioned centrally, maintains a slow and steady pace alongside the main direction, and a fourth person moves parallel on the right side. All demonstrate normal pedestrian behaviors without any unusual deviations from the path.",
    "245": " In a busy urban walkway, several individuals move along a clear pathway bordered by a building structure. A person descends the stairs from the left side, entering into the flow of foot traffic. Meanwhile, three people continue straight along the central paving, showcasing normal pedestrian movement. The scene unfolds with ordinary, expected behavior within this public setting, with no detectable anomalies or interactions.",
    "252": " - In an open, covered area, several individuals move along a wide sidewalk leading to a building entrance. On the left, a person stands still near the edge of the path, while another walks slowly toward the entrance. In the center, a person briskly approaches the doorway, and on the right, another stands observing the scene. All actions align with typical pedestrian behavior, showing a mix of standing and walking along the main path.",
    "253": " In a calm, open pathway near a building entrance, four individuals exhibit typical pedestrian behaviors. One person stands calmly on the grass, observing the path, while another walks past the building entrance, maintaining a steady pace. Meanwhile, a third person is similarly placed on the grass, moving gradually towards the building, and a fourth individual stands near the entrance, perhaps waiting. All actions appear normal, with no significant deviations from expected pedestrian movement.",
    "254": " The open campus area features a wide walkway bordered by grass, leading to a building entrance. A person stands near the grass, gazing towards the building, while another walks along the paved path towards the entrance, both following typical movement patterns. Another pedestrian is near the corner of the building, slightly deviating towards the wall before approaching the entrance pathway. A fourth person is exiting the building, adhering to the expected flow of movement. All actions align with regular pedestrian behaviors in this public pathway setting, as individuals move towards or away from building access points without apparent deviation from their intended paths.",
    "255": " In this surveillance scene, several individuals interact with the environment. One person is approaching from the left, walking steadily along the main path, while another is centrally positioned under the building, standing still and possibly observing their surroundings. To the right, a pedestrian moves purposefully along the path's edge, and another stands near an entrance, possibly engaging in an interaction. The stationary behavior of the central and right-side individuals may suggest waiting or interaction, contrasting with the typical movement pattern on the pathway.",
    "256": " In a spacious pedestrian walkway, several individuals traverse the area. One person on the left walks straight ahead on the main path, while another in the middle continues forward along the same direction. A third person wanders off diagonally towards the grassy area, potentially indicating intent to access a nearby building. The scene depicts typical pedestrian movement with minor deviation, suggesting purposeful navigation through the environment."
