Groups converge in the center, walking towards the entrance with a typical flow. One individual on the right moves briskly toward the building, maintaining the path's main direction. The scene reflects ordinary pedestrian behavior with no notable deviations or anomalies.\"",
    "462": " \"The scene captures a paved area leading to a building entrance where pedestrians are engaging in typical movement patterns. On the main pathway, individuals move towards the entrance with some walking in pairs, indulging in casual conversation, while others occasionally pause, possibly to check their phones. The flow of movement is steady with no unusual deviations from the path, maintaining a typical pedestrian environment.\"",
    "464": " In a public space with a paved walkway, several individuals are walking towards a building entrance. On the left, a person moves steadily along the main path. Two individuals walk side by side in the center, maintaining a typical pedestrian pace. Near the grass, another person navigates back towards the main path, while on the far right, one more individual proceeds towards the entrance. All actions align with regular pedestrian behavior, moving intentionally towards the building without any deviations or unusual interactions.",
    "465": " In a public walkway leading to a building entrance, pedestrians are observed moving in and out of the structure. On the left, a person walks steadily towards the entrance. Two individuals in the center walk side by side in conversation, heading directly into the building. Near the entrance, a person deviates slightly by walking away, contrasting the main flow of traffic. On the far right, a stationary figure faces away from the building, possibly waiting or contemplating a course of action. Overall, the scene reflects typical pedestrian behavior with slight deviations.",
    "466": " In a semi-open public area, several pedestrians are using the main pathway leading to a building entrance. Among them, one individual stands near the entrance holding a mobile device, potentially waiting or checking information. Most pedestrians are moving steadily towards the entrance, except for one person who crosses the path to the grass, deviating from the typical walking direction. This deviation suggests either a shortcut or an unusual movement pattern. Overall, the scene displays a mixture of normal pedestrian flow with minor anomalies in movement.",

Slightly off-center, a pair walks in unison, maintaining a steady pace toward the entrance, suggesting typical pedestrian behavior. Another person follows a similar route alone, moving directly along the path. Meanwhile, near the entrance, a person stands still, possibly waiting or preparing to enter. All observed movements are consistent with normal use of the area, with no anomalies detected.",

On the left, someone approaches the stairs, suggesting a change in path towards an upper level. Central figures include a person directly walking towards the entrance and another following a steady straight path. To the right, two individuals exit, with one notable deviation as a person crosses the main path perpendicularly, briefly disrupting the expected flow of pedestrian movement. This deviation stands out in an otherwise orderly scene.",
    "472": " The scene unfolds in a busy pedestrian area adjacent to a building entrance. Individuals move consistently along the main pathway towards the entrance, displaying typical pedestrian behavior. One person, slightly off the path, walks casually on the grass before aligning towards the main pavement. Their deviation is minimal, aligning eventually with the common flow of movement into the building. The orderly movement suggests a routine entry into the premises, with negligible anomalies in behavior.",

On the right, another person enters the building directly. All movements align with typical pedestrian behavior, with no observable deviations from the main path.",
    "476": " \"The scene depicts a busy pedestrian area where individuals are navigating towards a building entrance along the main sidewalk. Near the center, a person walks steadily towards the building, while another stands still by the entrance, possibly waiting. Further back, a person continues on the central path at a normal pace. To the right, an individual moves rapidly, perhaps in a hurry, but maintains alignment with the walkway. Near the grassy area, another person walks leisurely, staying within the sidewalk's confines. All actions appear typical, with no significant deviations from expected pedestrian behavior.\"",
    "477": " In an open public area leading to building entrances, pedestrians adhere to the main path's direction, calmly walking towards the stairway and doors. A person on the left stands near the entrance, possibly engaged in conversation, while another individual follows the standard flow towards the stairway. At the center, an individual deviates by jogging, an unusual behavior amidst the otherwise tranquil pedestrian activity. Meanwhile, on the far right, a person interacts with the building entrance, possibly going in or out, reinforcing the scene's routine nature.",
    "479": " In the scene, several pedestrians are visible within an open space consisting of a central paved walkway leading to a building entrance. A man near the center walks towards the entrance, maintaining alignment with the main footpath.
