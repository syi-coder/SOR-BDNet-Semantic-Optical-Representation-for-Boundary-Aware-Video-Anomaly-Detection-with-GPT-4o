    "1117": " In an open space with a tiled walkway and grassy surroundings, people are moving towards a building entrance situated in the background. Several individuals walk along the right side of the path in a coordinated manner. One central person seems to be standing still amid the flow, potentially waiting or observing. The movement is orderly, with no one deviating from the main pathway or displaying unusual behavior, maintaining the typical flow of pedestrian traffic toward the entrance.",
    "1119": " In an open, sheltered pathway leading to a building entrance, pedestrians are steadily walking along the main path. Most of them are heading toward the entrance without notable deviation. One person walks centrally and another on the right, both maintaining a steady pace. Another individual moves slightly diagonally but still progresses toward the entrance, likely maneuvering to avoid others. Near the entrance, someone stands momentarily, perhaps waiting or preparing to enter. There are no significant anomalies or unusual behaviors, as everyone appears focused on reaching their destination inside the building.",
    "1120": " The scene takes place in an open environment with a broad walkway leading to a building entrance. Multiple individuals are visible, all moving towards the entrance in an orderly manner. Two people on the right are walking purposefully towards the building, while a person in the center maintains a steady pace in line with the main direction. On the left, two individuals slightly off the path are still heading towards the entrance, with no signs of unusual behavior or deviations from expected pedestrian movement.",
    "1123": " \"The scene captures a group of pedestrians moving towards a building entrance across a paved path. Each individual maintains a steady, straight trajectory, aligning with the normal flow of foot traffic. Positioned at varying points on the walkway, none exhibit unusual behavior, as all progress towards the doorways in a typical manner.\"",
    "1124": " In a bustling scene outside a building entrance, pedestrians navigate the main walkway with fluency. Person A advances from the left, while Person B strides confidently in the center, adhering closely to the path. Over to the right, Person C pauses briefly, resulting in a minor deviation, whereas Person D stands by the entrance wall, possibly awaiting a companion. The scene unfolds with regular movement patterns amid habitual transit in a public setting.",
    "1126": " \"In a public access area with a paved path leading to a building entrance, individuals are seen consistently walking towards the entrance. Positioned centrally along the path, pedestrians maintain a steady pace, demonstrating typical behavior indicative of entering a public building. No deviations from the primary path or unusual movements are observed.\"",
    "1127": " In an open space leading to a building, pedestrians walk along the main path. Most individuals are steadily approaching the entrance, maintaining a straight course. However, one person near the edge appears to be adjusting their path, showing slight hesitation. This deviation from the direct walk is notable in contrast to the usual pedestrian flow.",
    "1128": " The scene captures a group of pedestrians moving steadily towards the entrance of a building from the sidewalk. The individuals are walking in an organized manner, following the designated path without any unusual deviations or behavior. The environment is consistent with a typical public walkway leading to a building entrance, where pedestrians exhibit standard movement patterns.",
    "1129": " The scene depicts an open public area with a clear pathway leading to a building entrance. Five individuals are visible, each positioned along the pathway. All are moving in a coordinated manner toward the entrance, displaying typical pedestrian behavior. No unusual actions, such as abrupt stops or detours from the main path, are observed, suggesting routine activity associated with entering the facility.",
    "1130": " \"In an open, public access area leading to a building entrance, individuals are observed engaging in typical pedestrian behavior. One person is walking directly towards the entrance along the main path, while another stands near the entrance, likely interacting with others. A third individual, initially off the path, approaches the walkway, indicating a transition back to the central flow of foot traffic. All actions align with expected behaviors for this setting, with no significant deviations noted.\"",
    "1131": " \"The scene is situated in an open public area adjacent to a building entrance, where several individuals are visible. Each person follows the primary walking path towards the entrance, maintaining a steady pace. No unusual behaviors are observed as everyone adheres to typical pedestrian routes, demonstrating orderly movement along the pathway.\"",
    "1132": " In the scene, a bustling path leads towards a building entrance, where several pedestrians converge seamlessly as they approach or enter the building. Except for one individual standing on the grass on the left, most people follow the designated path, consistent with expected pedestrian flow. The person on the grass deviates from the norm, which could suggest waiting for someone or an intentional pause outside the main walking route.",
    "1134": " \"The scene captures a public area with a sidewalk leading to a building. A steady flow of pedestrians is moving towards the entrance. One person stands still on the side, near the grassy area, deviating from the common direction of pedestrian movement. This stationary stance contrasts with the others who continue toward the entrance, possibly indicating atypical behavior.\"",
    "1136": " The scene depicts a walkway leading to a building entrance with people moving in typical patterns. One person stands still near the grass while two others walk toward the entrance, maintaining a steady pace. Another pedestrian on the right proceeds similarly, all following the main path without deviations or unusual actions.",
    "1138": " In a busy public area, pedestrians are walking towards the entrance of a building along a designated paved walkway. Each person maintains a steady flow as they head inside, with no deviations or unusual actions observed. The scene is typical of a bustling environment with people naturally gravitating towards the indoor entrance.",
    "1139": " - \"In the busy outdoor setting, several individuals proceed along the main pathway toward the entrance of a building, moving efficiently through the open doors. Their behavior aligns with normal pedestrian flow as they walk in a straightforward manner, disappearing into the interior without deviation.\"",
    "1140": " In front of a building with a wide walkway, individuals are seen moving toward the entrance in an orderly manner. One person walks near the center of the path, heading directly for the entrance without deviation. Another person on the right side follows a similar path towards the entrance. Near the steps on the left, people are ascending. Overall, all visible actions align with typical pedestrian behavior, and no unusual activities are present."
